Introduction

This report investigates the relationship between exam dates and search behavior based on historical search data and a dataset of exam dates. The primary objective is to determine whether the frequency of daily searches decreases during exam periods, including the 10 days leading up to the exam date.
Also, the reason of choosing this pathway is because my main social media platform is youtube. I almost spent most of my time in this platform.

Datasets

1. Filtered Daily Search Counts
Source: filtered_daily_search_counts_2024.csv
Description: Contains daily search counts for the year 2024, excluding July and August to focus on active academic months.
2. Exam Counts with Subjects
Source: exam_counts_with_subjects_2024.csv
Description: Contains exam dates along with the number of exams and associated subjects for each day.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing:
Dates with invalid or missing values were excluded.
Search counts were categorized as:
Exam Period or Exam Date: Dates within 10 days leading up to an exam, including the exam date.
Other Dates: All other dates.
Analysis:
Search counts were aggregated by category (Exam Period or Exam Date vs. Other).
Mean and median were calculated for both categories to observe overall trends.
Visualizations were generated to represent data trends and facilitate understanding.
Findings

1. Key Statistics
Other Dates (Blue):
Mean Search Count: 15.32
Median Search Count: 14.0
Exam Period or Exam Date (Green/Red):
Mean Search Count: 10.45
Median Search Count: 9.0
2. Observations
Search counts are significantly lower during exam periods compared to other dates.
The mean and median for Exam Period or Exam Date are consistently lower, indicating reduced online activity during these times.
Visualizations

1. Histogram of Daily Search Counts

During this visualization process, I wanted to show that number of search counts during exam period,
is almost remained same as other days' search counts.

Blue: Search counts for dates outside exam periods.
Green/Red: Search counts for exam periods and exam dates.
The mean and median lines indicate a significant drop in search activity during exam periods.
2. Total Search Counts by Category

But, in this visualization, I realised that during exam day, the number of searches dramatically decreased.

Displays the total search counts for Exam Period or Exam Date and Other dates.
Highlights the disparity in search behavior between the two categories.
3. Grouped Bar Chart: Search Counts by Month
Visualizes search counts for each month, split into Exam Period or Exam Date and Other.
Reinforces the pattern of lower search activity during exam times.
Conclusion

The analysis conclusively shows a reduction in search activity during exam periods. This behavior aligns with the hypothesis that students are less engaged in online activities as they prepare for and focus on exams.

This insight can inform future studies, such as:

Identifying patterns in specific search terms during exams.
Comparing data across different years to validate consistency.
Future Work
Explore the content of searches (e.g., educational vs. recreational) during exam periods.
Compare search patterns with academic performance to uncover potential correlations.

In this project, my main purpose is to create a relationship between my exam preparation process,
and the number of youtube searches during that period. According to the analysis, I proved that
there is lower search counts during my exam period, but not seriously big change is happened. So
at the end of the project I realised that there is no direct relationship, between my exam preparation
and youtube search counts, but during exam day, count of searches searches dramatically decreased.
